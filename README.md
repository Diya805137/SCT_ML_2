# 📊 K-Means Clustering Project

This project demonstrates **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters.

The model identifies natural patterns in the dataset **without using labeled output**.

## 📌 Project Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**

   * NumPy & Pandas → data handling
   * Matplotlib → visualization
   * Scikit-learn → K-Means algorithm

2. **Load Dataset**

   * Dataset is read from a CSV file for clustering analysis.

3. **Data Preparation**

   * Selected useful numerical features
   * Checked and handled missing values

4. **Finding Optimal Clusters**

   * Used the **Elbow Method**
   * Determined the best number of clusters (K)

5. **Apply K-Means Algorithm**

   * Trained the **K-Means model**
   * Assigned cluster labels to each data point

6. **Visualization**

   * Scatter plot showing:

     * Different clusters in different colors
     * Cluster centroids (center points)

## 🧠 What is K-Means Clustering?

K-Means is an **unsupervised learning algorithm** that:

* Divides data into **K clusters**
* Groups **similar data points together**
* Minimizes distance between points and their cluster center

Common real-world uses:

* Customer segmentation
* Market analysis
* Image compression
* Recommendation systems
